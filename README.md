we were ecstatic about moving forward as soon as possible.

## Usage

The user signs up or logs in and they are presented with a choice - Football or Futbol. Then the user is directed to a page where they can select a player or create a player with their desired stats. Once this is done the user can select or create a player from the other sport.
Once both players are selected they battle! Stats from both players are compared and a winner is declared. Users can also create their own players, maybe even create themselves to see how they measure up against PRO athletes. The application includes a database with 200 PRO players that the user can compare.
