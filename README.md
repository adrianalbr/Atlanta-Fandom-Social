I'm sure me and my team can all agree that inspiration came in abundance when building this application. To simply put it, we live and breathe for this culture, we consume it daily, it's our bread and butter, and so when being presented with the idea, 
we were ecstatic about moving forward as soon as possible.

## Usage

Our application is a very pleasant simple experience for our consumers. 
* Upon loading the application, the user will sign up using our form. 
* They will then be greeted with a beautiful UI with dozens of posts from already existing users. These posts can range from a variety of categories such as comics, anime, cosplay, video games, conventions, etc. The posts can be anything from an article, memes, upcoming events, convention news, and so much more. 
* If a user wishes to post and join in on the fun then they can simply click on "Create Post" in the navbar. From there, they can type in their desired fields and even put in a image url. Once they create the post, they will be magically redirected to home and their post will be displayed at the top. 
* If you wanted to save any particular post that can easily be done with clicking the heart icon near the bottom of the post. To view said post, simply navigate to the saved posts button on the left side of the screen. 
* Going to the navbar and selecting "My posts" will redirect you to a page with ONLY your created posts. From there you have the ability to edit and delete your post. Selecting delete will simply delete your posts while selecting edit will redirect you to a form page in which you can edit your desired fields.  
* In home, there is search functionality with the ability to search by author and title. This functionality is also present in the "My posts page."
* A highly anticipated feature we're glad we incorporated is "upcoming events". This is a section in our home page in which the users can see as the title suggests, upcoming events usually conventions.
